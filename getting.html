<h3> Shuttle Bus Information </h3>
<p>
We are planning on organising a bus to guests. If you are interested in taking the bus please let us know on your RSVP. If you register your interest, we will contact you when we have more information.
</p>
<p>
The bus will pick you up from a central location (e.g., the city) at around 2:15pm and take you to the ceremony (Burbrook Forest). The bus will also shuttle you between the ceremony and the reception. The bus will leave from the reception (Kuitpo Hall) at 11:30pm.
</p>

<h3>Parking</h3> 
<p>
There is parking at both the ceremony and reception venues. Please see <a href="#wedding">The Wedding</a> for a map outlining parking locations.

</p>
<p>
Cars can be left overnight at the parking lot opposite Kuitpo Hall.
</p>

<h3>Taxis</h3>
<p>
Taxis and Ubers do not regularly service Kuitpo. If you would like a taxi it will need to be pre-booked.
